# VPN Network Implementation Project (Cisco Packet Tracer)

This project demonstrates the successful implementation of a **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** across a large-scale simulated network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**.  
The goal was to establish secure connectivity and reliable communication between multiple routers and endpoints within an extended IP range.

---

## 🧠 Overview

The VPN network was built using **25 routers** interconnected across multiple subnets.  
It provides a secure communication channel between remote networks, ensuring **data privacy, integrity, and reliability** throughout the topology.

## ⚙️ Project Details

- **Simulation Tool:** Cisco Packet Tracer  
- **Total Routers:** 25  
- **Main Network Range:** `10.0.0.0 - 35.0.0.0`  
- **VPN Network Range:** `192.168.10.0 - 192.168.25.0`  
- **Routing Protocols Used:** Static / Dynamic (specify if applicable)  
- **Testing Method:** End-to-end Ping and Connectivity Tests

## 🔍 Testing & Verification

To verify the VPN’s functionality:

1. A **switch** and a **PC** were connected to two routers located at **opposite ends** of the network.  
2. The VPN tunnel was configured and activated between the routers.  
3. **Ping tests** were conducted between the two endpoints, successfully confirming secure communication through the VPN.

## 📈 Key Features

- Large-scale topology with **25 interconnected routers**  
- Implementation of **site-to-site VPN tunnels**  
- **End-to-end encryption** for secure data transfer  
- **Subnet-based IP addressing** for organized routing  
- Verification via real-time **connectivity tests**

## 🧩 Results

✅ The VPN connection was successfully established and verified.  
✅ Secure and stable communication achieved between endpoints.  
✅ All routes and subnets functioned as expected across the topology.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the `.pkt` file in **Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.0 or later)**.  
2. Review the router configurations and VPN setup.  
3. Connect PCs or switches to test connectivity.  
4. Run **ping tests** between distant routers to verify VPN functionality.
