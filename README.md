VPN Network Implementation Project

This project demonstrates the successful implementation of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) across a simulated large-scale network consisting of 25 routers. The main objective was to configure, test, and verify secure connectivity between multiple network nodes using different network ranges.

🧠 Overview

The VPN was designed and configured to establish secure communication between devices located on different routers within the same logical network. The project ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and reliability across the simulated environment.

⚙️ Project Details

Total Routers: 25

Main Network Range: 10.0.0.0 - 35.0.0.0

VPN Network Range: 192.168.10.0 - 192.168.25.0

Configuration Tools: MikroTik RouterOS / Cisco Packet Tracer / GNS3 (based on your setup — specify one if applicable)

Verification Method: Ping test and routing table analysis

🔍 Testing & Verification

To verify the VPN’s functionality:

A switch and a PC were connected to two routers located at opposite ends of the network.

The VPN tunnel was established successfully.

Ping tests between both endpoints confirmed secure and stable connectivity.

📈 Key Features

Large-scale network topology (25 routers)

Encrypted VPN tunnel configuration

Multi-network routing setup

End-to-end connectivity verification

Efficient IP management across multiple subnets

🧩 Results

The VPN connection was successfully established and validated. All configured routes functioned as expected, and secure data transmission between endpoints was achieved.
